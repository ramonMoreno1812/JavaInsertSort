Insert Sort Project

This project takes two arrays of different types and sorts them using the
Insert Sort Algorithm. This program takes in two prepared arrays of type
int and string and sorts them in ascending order, and ABC order, respectively. 
The arrays are printed to the console, sorted and then again sorted.
